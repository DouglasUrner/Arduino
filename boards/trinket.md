# Adafruit [Trinket][tk] & [Trinket Pro][tkp]

From Adafruit:
>**Deprecation Warning:** The bit-bang USB technique the Trinket uses doesn't work as well as it did in 2014, many modern computers won't work well. So while we still carry the Trinket so that people can maintain some older projets, we no longer recommend it.
